# BigChainDB
## Overview
- BigchainDB is called a blockchain database because it has some blockchain properties and some database properties. 
- Below, we go through each design goal of BigchainDB 2.0 and outline how it was achieved.

## Full Decentralization and Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- In BigchainDB 2.0, each node has its own local MongoDB database [5], and all communication between nodes is done using Tendermint protocols.
```
Tendermint: Tendermint is software for securely and consistently replicating an application on many machines. . By securely, we mean that Tendermint works even if up to 1/3 of machines fail in arbitrary ways. By consistently, we mean that every non-faulty machine sees the same transaction log and computes the same state.

Tendermint consists of two chief technical components: a blockchain consensus engine and a generic application interface
```
- Why do use Tendermint?
    - The system is solve the problem BFT.
    - When node is delete or worsted the data in that local database;, other nodes,the MongoDB databases in the other nodes won’t be affected.

- If every node in a BigchainDB 2.0 network is owned and operated by a
different person or entity, then it’s a decentralized network. Any node can fail and the rest of the network will continue to operate.

## Immutability
- The data in BigChain can not change or delete.
- The BigchainDB uses several strategies sush as:
    - Do not provide API change or delete.
    - Every node has a full copy of all the data in a standalone MongoDB database.
    - All transactions are cryptographically signed. After a transaction is stored, changing its contents will change the signature
